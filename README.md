# proof-of-play-blockchain

Creating a "proof-of-play" blockchain involves designing a system where the gaming actions of players contribute to the security and validation of in-game actions, using these actions as entropy for securing the blockchain. Here’s a high-level overview of how this could be accomplished:

Key Components
Game Mechanics Integration: Integrate game mechanics with blockchain functions to capture player actions.
Action Validation: Ensure that the actions are legitimate and can be verified.
Entropy Generation: Use the player actions to generate entropy for securing the blockchain.
Consensus Mechanism: Design a consensus mechanism that utilizes this entropy.
Rewards and Incentives: Provide incentives for players to engage in the game and contribute to the blockchain’s security.
Smart Contracts: Use smart contracts to automate and secure in-game transactions and actions.
Step-by-Step Implementation
1. Game Mechanics Integration
Data Capture: Capture game actions (e.g., moves, trades, combat results) in real-time.
Logging: Log these actions securely and deterministically in a format suitable for blockchain integration.
2. Action Validation
Oracles and Validators: Use oracles to validate the authenticity of player actions. These could be automated systems or community-driven validators.
Proof of Authenticity: Develop a system where game actions are hashed and stored, creating a trail that can be audited.
3. Entropy Generation
Randomness from Actions: Combine multiple game actions to generate a random seed. For example, the positions of characters in a game, the outcomes of battles, and resource trades can all contribute to this randomness.
Entropy Pool: Maintain an entropy pool that collects these seeds and combines them to create a secure source of randomness.
4. Consensus Mechanism
Proof of Play: Design a consensus algorithm where nodes validate blocks based on the proof of play. Nodes could be rewarded based on their participation and validation of these in-game actions.
Block Creation: Create blocks where the hash includes the combined entropy from game actions. These blocks are validated by consensus nodes that verify the legitimacy and randomness of the actions.
5. Rewards and Incentives
In-Game Rewards: Provide in-game rewards (e.g., rare items, currency) for players who contribute significant actions that enhance security.
Cryptocurrency Rewards: Reward players and validators with cryptocurrency or tokens for their participation and validation work.
6. Smart Contracts
Automated Transactions: Use smart contracts to handle in-game transactions, ensuring they are secure and immutable.
Event-Driven Contracts: Create contracts that trigger specific events based on game actions (e.g., awarding a prize when a quest is completed).
Example Workflow
Player Action: A player moves to a new location in the game.
Action Logging: The action is logged and hashed.
Validation: Oracles validate the move (e.g., checking it against game rules and previous actions).
Entropy Generation: The validated action’s hash is added to the entropy pool.
Block Creation: A new block is proposed, using the entropy pool to generate the block’s hash.
Consensus: Nodes validate the block, ensuring it follows the proof-of-play rules and that the entropy is legitimate.
Reward Distribution: The block is added to the chain, and rewards are distributed to the player and validators.
Technical Considerations
Scalability: Ensure the system can handle a high volume of game actions without compromising performance.
Security: Protect against cheating and ensure the entropy generation is truly random and tamper-proof.
Interoperability: Design the system to work with various games and platforms, possibly through standardized APIs.
User Experience: Ensure the integration is seamless and does not detract from the gaming experience.
Conclusion
Creating a proof-of-play blockchain is a complex task that involves integrating game mechanics with blockchain technology to use player actions as a source of entropy. This approach can enhance both the security and engagement of in-game actions, providing a novel way to secure blockchain networks while incentivizing player participation.
